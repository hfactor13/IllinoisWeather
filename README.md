1. extracting_weather_data.ipynb

2. weather_analysis.ipynb (once step one is ran you don't have to run it again the CSV file is to save on querying charges)

The dataset was extracted from Google BigQuery using the extracting_weather_data.ipynb script which is exported to a CSV file.
The CSV file is then loaded into a DataFrame for which the exploratory data analysis is done (weather_analysis.ipynb).
